# Building a robust GraphQL API with TypeScript, DDD and Clean Architecture

Building software for small businesses is not easy. Learn how to leverage the power of DDD and Clean Architecture principles with a GraphQL API as a unified umbrella on top of all subdomains to create a scalable and maintainable system.

We will discover the importance of modularization and subdomain organization. We will explore how to better design and build our API around the business domain. We will see a layered approach to structuring our modules.

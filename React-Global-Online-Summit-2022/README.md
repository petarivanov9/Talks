# Bootstrap to Tailwind and Beyond

How did we migrate from Angular to React & Bootstrap and then from Bootstrap to Tailwind?

We will go step by step to the migration journey we went through with one of our clients regarding their customer-facing web application.

We will go through:

- our migration strategy and the why behind it;
- some of the failures we had and the lessons we have learned from them;
- some anti-patterns and some good practices from our own experience and point of view
